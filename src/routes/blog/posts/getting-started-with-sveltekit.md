# Getting Started with SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

## Why SvelteKit?

SvelteKit provides:

1. **File-based routing** - Just create files in the `src/routes` directory
2. **Server-side rendering** - Fast initial page loads
3. **Static site generation** - Deploy anywhere
4. **API routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend

## Quick Start

To create a new SvelteKit project:

```bash
pnpm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
