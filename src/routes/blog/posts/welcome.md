# Welcome to My Blog

This is the first post on my new blog! I built this using **SvelteKit** and **mdsvex**, which allows me to write blog posts in markdown.

## Features

Here are some of the things you can do with markdown:

- Write **bold** and _italic_ text
- Create lists
- Add code blocks
- And much more!

### Code Example

```js
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share more content here. Stay tuned for updates!
